# Overview

Assigned readings are worth __5%__ of your overall course grade. 

We expect to assign approximately five readings over the length of the quarter.
Each assigned reading has a corresponding open-ended question that will be submitted and graded.
We have set reading deadlines that give you the flexibility to read before or after the related lectures.
Do whichever is best for your personal learning style.

Responses are expected to be at most a couple paragraphs.
Their role is to get you engaged with and thinking about the material.
They will be graded according to whether they provide evidence you understood and considered the material in responding.

We will make additional resources available for students to read as interested.

# Assigned Readings

<a name="contextual_inquiry"></a>

### Reading 1: Contextual Inquiry

Read:

- [Beyer and Holtzblatt (1997). Contextual Design. Chapter 3.]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings/ContextualInquiry-BeyerHoltzblatt1997.pdf)
  
Due: Uploaded the night before section {{ page.date_reading_contextual_inquiry }}.

After reading, consider how you might apply this approach to the project you proposed in Assignment 1b.

- Briefly, what is your proposal (e.g., two sentences).
- Who and what might you propose to observe in a contextual inquiry (e.g., two sentences).
- What focus might you bring to your observation, and why? (e.g., two or three sentences).
- Identify a pitfall that seems likely (e.g., getting caught in abstractions) (e.g., two or three sentences).
- Describe how you might avoid or attempt to correct for this pitfall in your inquiry (e.g., two or three sentences).

This reading thus serves as some practice planning a contextual inquiry before moving on to your primary project.

### Reading 2: Critique and Teamwork

Read:

After reading, please think back to your previous experiences working in groups, particularly an experience that could have been improved.
  
- Briefly describe the project and the group (e.g., two sentences).
- What went poorly in this group (e.g., two sentences)?
- From concepts discussed in these readings, what could have been done differently to improve the group experience (e.g., up to two paragraphs)?

These readings thus reflection on receiving feedback, prior group experiences, and how to maximize your success in this course.

Due: Uploaded the night before section {{ page.date_reading_videos }}.

After viewing, consider what approaches were more or less effective in these examples.

- In one paragraph, describe a technique you saw in these videos that was highly effective.
  Be specific, such that it is clear you watched the videos.
  Discuss why it was effective.  
- In one paragraph, describe a technique you saw that was ineffective. 
  Be specific, such that it is clear you watched the videos.
  Discuss why it was ineffective.

These videos thus support your reflection on how to effectively develop and illustrate a design.
Techniques in these and other videos will also directly apply as you prepare a video later this quarter.

### Reading 4: Paper Prototyping and Usability Testing

Read:

- [Rettig (1994). Prototyping for Tiny Fingers]({{site.baseurl}}/readings/PaperPrototyping-Rettig1994.pdf)
- [Snyder (2003). Paper Prototyping. Chapter 4.]({{site.baseurl}}/readings/PaperPrototyping-Chapter4-Snyder2003.pdf)
- [Snyder (2003). Paper Prototyping. Chapter 8.]({{site.baseurl}}/readings/PaperPrototyping-Chapter8-Snyder2003.pdf)
- [Gomoll (1992). Some Techniques for Observing Users.]({{site.baseurl}}/readings/PaperPrototyping-Gomoll1992.pdf)

Optionally, check out this video on paper prototyping:

- [Nielsen Norman Group. Paper Prototyping: A How-To Video.](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/videos/paperprototyping/NielsenNorman.mp4)

Due: Uploaded by the end of the day {{ page.date_reading_paper_prototyping }}.

After reading, consider how you might apply this approach in your paper prototyping and usability testing.

- Describe an specific idea or thought you might be able to apply in your paper prototyping and usability testing.
- Describe why this idea is non-obvious or how it well help ensure good results for your paper prototyping and usability testing.
- Describe what in the readings gave you this idea.

Your thoughts here should be specific. 
You are already required to do a paper prototype with usability testing, so that is obviously too high-level. 
Convey a specific idea that indicates you did the reading and thought about how to apply it in the context of your project.

This reading thus serves to get you thinking about these methods in the context of your project.

What actual techniques your team applies will depend on your larger decisions as a team. 
Nothing about this reading is intended to require that you actually apply the ideas you individually develop here.

### Reading 5: Research Paper

`Content is still being developed and migrated to this site, everything here should be considered temporary and subject to change`

Due: Uploaded by the end of the day Friday, December 5, 2014.

Researchers and designers often re-invent. 
Instead it is valuable to take advantage of what is already known.
To do this, you need to find and understand prior results.
Find and read a research paper related to your project. 
The paper does not necessarily have to describe an app or device. 
For example, the research paper may describing the results of surveys or interviews on how people currently track something related to your project. 

We have discussed a number of research papers in this class from HCI-related conferences such as:

- [CHI](http://chi2015.acm.org/)
- [UIST](http://www.acm.org/uist/uist2014/)
- [UbiComp](http://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2014/)

But you might find a research paper in another related field, such as psychology or medicine.

Two sites that work well for finding research papers are [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/) and the [ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org/). 
The search tool for the ACM Digital Library is pretty terrible.
Google search of the Digital Library can often help, like [this](https://www.google.com/#q=personal+informatics+site:dl.acm.org). 
These resources are easiest to access while on the UW network, but you can also access them off campus using the [UW Libraries proxy](http://www.lib.washington.edu/help/connect.html).

- In one paragraph, summarize the findings of the research paper. 
  - What were the main points of this paper? 
  - Given the paper, do you believe those main points?
- In one paragraph, describe how the paper applies to your project. 
  - After reading this paper, is there anything you wish you had done differently in your design? 
  - Do you think you've designed something that's improved upon what this paper discusses?

If you wish, you can do this assignment in __pairs__ from your project team. Please have only one person submit, and remember to include both of your names in the submission.

No more than one page of text in PDF format. 

Also submit a PDF of the research paper you read.
